# pandas-challenge
This is the repository for Module 4 challenge: Pandas
I began my importing the files from the Starter_Code folder to the repository, so it would be easier to path to. 
I then copied the PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb to my repoistory as well, since it already has all of the cells labelled and ready for clarification. As I completed the lines of code the Description perfectly shows why I entered the code and how I got there.
To create the high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics into a DataFrame, I just displayed all of the values that I had been calculating up to that point into one DataFrame.
